# Branch Protection Setup

This document describes the required branch protection rules for `nuewframe/okta-client`.
Apply them with the automated script or follow the manual steps below.

## Automated Setup

```bash
# Requires: gh CLI authenticated with admin access
REPO=nuewframe/okta-client sh scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
```

## Manual Setup (GitHub UI)

Navigate to **Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule** and target `main`:

### Required Status Checks

| Require branches to be up to date | ✅ enabled    |
| Status checks required            | `Test & Lint` |

> `Test & Lint` is the job name from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Pull Request Reviews

| Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed | ✅ enabled                                   |
| Require review from Code Owners                                  | ✅ enabled (reads from `.github/CODEOWNERS`) |
| Require approval of the most recent reviewable push              | ✅ enabled                                   |

### Additional Rules

| Setting                                        | Value                           |

| Allow deletions                                | ❌ disabled                     |
| Require conversation resolution before merging | ✅ enabled                      |

## Rulesets (Recommended)

In addition to branch protection, apply these via **Settings → Rules → Rulesets**:

- **Require signed commits** — ensures all commits are GPG/SSH signed
- **Block force pushes** — belt-and-suspenders alongside branch protection

## Repository Settings

Under **Settings → General**, configure:

| Setting                            | Value                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Allow merge commits                | ❌ disabled                                           |
| Allow squash merging               | ✅ enabled (use "Pull request title and description") |
| Allow rebase merging               | ❌ disabled                                           |
| Automatically delete head branches | ✅ enabled                                            |

Under **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**:

| Setting                                                  | Value      |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests | ✅ enabled |

> Required for `release-please` to open Release PRs automatically.
> Without it the release workflow fails with:
> _"GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"_

## How This Integrates with the Release Workflow

1. Developer opens a feature branch and creates a PR
2. CI (`ci.yml`) runs `deno task test`, `deno lint`, `deno fmt --check`
3. A maintainer in `@nuewframe/maintainers` (defined in `.github/CODEOWNERS`) reviews and approves
4. PR is squash-merged to `main`
5. `release.yml` fires: `release-please-action` inspects the commit, updates the Release PR
6. When the Release PR is merged → tag + GitHub release + platform binaries published automatically

No direct commits to `main`. No manual version bumps. No manual `deno task release` needed.
